# FastLearn
A student-teacher community portal to interact online after class to brainstorm queries and discuss among peers.

Students can view their course information, course materials, Post Queries, Send Feedback and change their Password online, 
whereas Faculty members can respond to those queries by replying to them via the studentâ€™s EmailID and change their passwords too. 
By this system students and faculty members can interact with each other anytime, anywhere.
